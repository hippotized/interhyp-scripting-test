# scripting-test

some time ago i was invited for a work trial day at a company. i had to fulfil some devops/operating related stuff. one of the tasks was to write a bash script that - as far as i can recall - takes two params, searches recursively from the current directory level files containing a searchstring.

gnu-versions of find and xargs were used.

i leave this here for for educational purposes.
